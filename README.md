**Greetings, my name is Alexander, and this is a page with various projects that I worked with while learning various DevOps and Cloud tools and methods. Most of the applications were found by me on the Internet. I deployed them in my own way, made small improvements. Each project has a description of how I did it, this is not a complete guide, but only a "way of doing". Thank you for your attention to my CV, have a good day :)**
